                Respected Sir,<br>
                <b>Greetings from SIAM VIT!</b><br><br>
                SIAM VIT (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) is a student-run international technical
                chapter, based out of the Vellore Institute of Technology. It aims to flourish and evolve the
                application of Industrial and Applied Mathematics among the student community. To achieve our goal, we
                conduct invigorating events, insightful webinars, and grand hackathons throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 3%;">
                We plan to conduct an online 2-day Hackathon, Hackulus tentatively in June 2022. Hackulus is an
                illustrious two-day online hackathon organized by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics
                (SIAM) at VIT Vellore. In 2021, the event witnessed the participation of over 1100 tech enthusiasts from
                all over the country. Hackulus aims to create a beginner-friendly and inclusive hackathon to inculcate
                unique and innovative solutions to real-world problems in various tracks.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 3%;">
                We would like to partner with your esteemed organization in our event. The Hackathon would provide your
                organization direct access to talented students and tech enthusiasts, working across various technical
                fronts, in various domains such as Web Development, App Development, Machine Learning, Blockchain,
                Cryptography, and many more.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 3%;">
                Your organization may provide customized Problem Statements or Internships in the hack. The problem
                statements are completely customizable. These could be any requirement that your company has or a
                technical solution requirement for an existing problem in your domain of work. They could be open-ended,
                for students to use their creativity to come up with a solution and working model, or they could also be
                very specific statements, depending on your requirement. Problem statements could vary from simple ones
                like developing a website for your organization to anything more complex like the use of blockchain or
                artificial intelligence technology to solve real-world problems and suggest solutions for the same.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 3%;">
                Among the numerous solutions presented by the participants for your problem statements, your
                organization can choose the ones that best fit your requirements and also provide winning prizes to
                these teams. Please find the attached brochure for your further reference.
